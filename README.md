##### About #####

PassVault is a password manager designed to be put on a flash drive,
so the only one with access to your passwords is you.  PassVault is
password protected, you can create and delete "vaults" (password lists),
you can add and edit existing passwords, and when ever you search for a
password, the password is automatically copied to your clipboard.

##### How-To #####

1. You're greeted with the welcome menu.  Here you can create a vault if
you don't have one already.  Creating a vault will delete the previous one.
You can also delete your vault from here or login.
If you enter the wrong username or password the app will automatically
close.

2. After logging in you will be presented with the main menu.  To add or
edit passwords you click on passwords then add or edit.
ex. passwords -> add or passwords -> edit.
To search for a password type in the website in the search bar, then
a pop up will appear with that websites username and password combo.  Also
when the pop up appears the password will automatically be copied to
your clipboard. So all you have to do is paste in the website.

3. Adding Websites - After you click add it'll take you to a new window
here you will put in the website or app, your username, and password. When
doing this keep in mind if your information is for a website the way you
type it in is the way you'll have to search for it. i.e. if you put
facebook.com searching facebook will not display your username or password.
Also usernames and passwords are case-sensitive.  If you need help
creating a password leave the password field blank and hit the generate
button this will save the added info plus a strong randomly generated
password.

4. Editing information - After you click on edit a new window with a search
bar will pop up. Type in the website or app name you need to edit and hit
search. This will pull up the edit screen here you can edit your password, username, or both. If you only need to update one fill that line and press the corresponding button. If you want to edit both fill in both lines and hit save both.
